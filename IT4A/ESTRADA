I am Ephraim John B. Estrada.
I dont like my nickname, it is too common.
My hometown is Digos City the most progressive city in the Philippines.
I like daydreaming because it is fun and free.
I like reading and watching new things about science and technology, even thought some of them are confusing.
I like watching formula 1 racing because it is very loud and fast.
I like Sid Meir’s Civilization video game series, I can build cities, armies, and nukes to obliterate my enemies.
If I won a lottery jackpot, the first thing I'll do is to pack my things and travel the whole world for 7 years.
I dream of flying a supersonic plane, then do a low pass flyby maneuver and create a sonic boom to scare my karaoke loving neighbours.
I dream of the Philippines becoming a developed country for the next 20 years.Amen.
